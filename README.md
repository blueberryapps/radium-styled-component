# radium-styled-component

yarn install radium-styled-component
```

## Development

```
yarn install
yarn eslint
yarn eslint:fix
yarn test
```

## CI and autopublish

On Circle CI you need to add `NPM_TOKEN` which has rights to publish package to npmjs.org.

Also when you provide `SLACK_TOKENS` radium-styled-component/YYY/ZZZZ
(take them as one string from url `https://hooks.slack.com/services/radium-styled-component/YYY/ZZZ`)
it will let you know about new version.

When code gets to master branch, it will try to publish,
so if version in package.json is different, it will push it automatically.
